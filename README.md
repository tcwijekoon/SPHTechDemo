# SPHTechDemo
SPHTech Assignment

This is a demo application which used below technologies
- Retrofit -  for network operations
- RealmDb - for cache data

Not uses any design patterns for unit test compatible as google suggests in this link
    https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-testing/index.html
because this has only single click in this project and unit testing for click event covers using instrumentation test.

For git operations I followed gitflow (https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
